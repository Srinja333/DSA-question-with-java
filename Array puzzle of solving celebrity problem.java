/*Array puzzle of solving celebrity problem
Asked In: GoogleFlipkartAmazonMicrosoft
You are in a party of N people, where only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present at the party, if yes, (s)he doesnâ€™t know anyone at the party. Your task is to find the celebrity at the party in Time Complexity O(n) Asked in: Google, Flipkart, Amazon, Microsoft

Example:

Input: 
matrix = [
  [1,1,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [1,1,1]
]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. matrix[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise matrix[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.

Hint1: create boolean matrix to find wether person A knows person B or not
Hint2 : No constraint for space complexity but time complexity should be O(n)
Problem level: Easy
